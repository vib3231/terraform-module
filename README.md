Terraform Modules - Concept & Explanation

What is a Terraform Module?
A Terraform module is a reusable, self-contained collection of Terraform configurations that help organize and manage infrastructure efficiently. Modules allow you to abstract and reuse infrastructure code, making it more maintainable and scalable.

Why Use Modules?

✅ Reusability – Define infrastructure once and reuse it across multiple projects

✅ Scalability – Helps manage complex architectures by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts

✅ Simplifies Maintenance – Easier updates and debugging

✅ Standardization – Promotes best practices across teams
