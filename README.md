Terraform Modules - Concept & Explanation

What is a Terraform Module?
A Terraform module is a reusable, self-contained collection of Terraform configurations that help organize and manage infrastructure efficiently. Modules allow you to abstract and reuse infrastructure code, making it more maintainable and scalable.

Why Use Modules?

✅ Reusability – Define infrastructure once and reuse it across multiple projects

✅ Scalability – Helps manage complex architectures by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts

✅ Simplifies Maintenance – Easier updates and debugging

✅ Standardization – Promotes best practices across teams

📂 Terraform Module Structure

A typical Terraform module consists of the following files:

├── main.tf         # Defines resources (e.g., EC2 instance, VPC, Security Groups)

├── variables.tf    # Defines input variables for customization

├── README.md       # Documentation about the module


🚀 Deployment Steps

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/vib3231/terraform-module.git
cd terraform-module

2️⃣ Initialize Terraform:

  terraform init

3️⃣ Plan the deployment:

terraform plan  #  command is used to preview the execution plan for a Terraform configuration

4️⃣ Apply changes and create the EC2 instance:

terraform apply  # this will create the resource

5️⃣ Destroy resources (if needed):

terraform destroy  # this will destroy the resource
